      As a first-year home-based high school robotics team working out of our garage and without a formal coach, we were honored to qualify for the VEX Robotics World Championship—one of the most competitive events in the world—representing Region 4 in California. This achievement took countless late nights filled with coding, building, and problem-solving, and we couldn’t have done it without the incredible support of our families.

      Over the past few years, we’ve also volunteered our time teaching robotics classes at ICEA, where we’ve seen firsthand how excited local kids are about STEM and robotics. Unfortunately, many of these children are unable to pursue their passion due to the high costs associated with robotics programs and competitions.

      This summer, we plan to return to ICEA to volunteer again—this time with a mission to reach even more kids, especially those from underprivileged communities in West Los Angeles. We want to teach them the fundamentals of robotics, help them join the ICEA robotics team, and support them all the way to VEX competitions—with the dream that some may even make it to the World Championship next year.

      To make our mission possible, we’re asking for your support. Your donation will go directly toward equipment, materials, and registration fees, allowing more students to access hands-on robotics education and competitive opportunities. With your help, we hope to inspire and empower the next generation of engineers, innovators, and community leaders.

      Thank you for supporting our vision!
